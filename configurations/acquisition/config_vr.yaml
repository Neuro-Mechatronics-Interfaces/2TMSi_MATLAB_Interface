#CONFIG_VR.YAML  Set the configuration for TMSiSAGA units to be used as "A" and "B" -- FOR "_PLUS" version ONLY
#
# These header notes are split up according to the top-level fields.
#
# -- SAGA --
#  -> Currently, only supports 2 SAGA at a time.
#  -> Valid options for "Unit" property of each are:
#     - "SAGA1"
#     - "SAGA2"
#     - "SAGA3"
#     - "SAGA4"
#     - "SAGA5"
#     - "SAGAA"
#     - "SAGAB"
#
# MAKE SURE TO KEEP TRACK OF WHICH UNIT IS ASSIGNED TAG "A" AND "B"
#   -> THIS IS CRITICAL FOR KEEPING TRACK OF WHICH LEADS WENT WHERE!
#
# TO ONLY USE 1 SAGA, SET `Enable: false` ON THE CORRESPONDING UNIT.
